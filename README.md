# Hand-Controlled Snake Game

This is a hand-controlled snake game using Python, Pygame, OpenCV, and Mediapipe.  
I adapted the original code and added improvements to make the snake move naturally with your left and right hand movements.  
Unlike traditional grid-based snake games, the snake **follows your finger smoothly**, moving point-to-point for precise control.
